        = How to build a Linux Kernel Module in Rust? \ A brief introduction.

        - Working as an embedded Software Engineer for ZÃ¼hlke Engineering
        - Until now I earn my money mostly C/C++ and Python.
        - First experiments with Rust in 2015.
        - After failing to outsmart the borrow checker, I became convinced that
          there is something behind the core ideas.
        - Since then I write most of private projects in Rust and published a few small crates.

        How did I end up here?

        - The announced Rust support in the Linux Kernel peaked my curiosity. So I wanted to try it out.
        - I implemented a kernel module task from my university in Rust.
        - The RustFest CFP was announced and I though this could be a topic for a talk.
        - Now I am standing in here to show you what I've built.

        T: Now that you know a little bit about me. Being an introduction talk, I want
           to know a little bit more about the audience.

        == Lets start with a few questions:
    ]

    #line-by-line()[
        - Who uses Linux (VM/WSL installations count)?
        - Who configured a Linux Kernel manually?
        - Who worked with Linux Kernel code written in C?
        - Who worked with Linux Kernel code written in Rust?
        - Who is familiar with morse code?

    #pdfpc.speaker-note(
        ```md
        - What is a character device? Well it's a file.
        - Its a device that communicates by processing byte sequences.
          These byte sequences are exchanged via file operations like
          open, close, read, write.
        ```
    )
]

#slide[
    #align(center)[
        == Write a character device to convert text to morse code!
    ]

    Requirements:

    #line-by-line()[
        - Device files are created/removed on kernel module loading/unloading.
        - The number of managed devices is configurable.
        - Device access is synchronized.
        - A Device implements basic file operations.
        - Errors sources are handled properly (OOM, encoding, signals...).

    ]

    #line-by-line()[
        - Gradual change instead of "move fast and break things".
        - Maintainers need to become Rust developers.
        - Contribution rules are not made to add new languages.
    ]

    #pdfpc.speaker-note(
        ```md
        - Why? Multiple reasons:
            - "Move fast and break thing isn't a thing in the kernel"
            - Kernel maintainers need to become rust developers.
            - Linux contribution rules are not made to add languages.
            Problematic rules are:
                - No duplicate drivers.
                - No code without in-tree usage.
            - Kernel abstractions are mostly added with new drivers and a lot are
              in the making:
                - Android Binder Driver (android sandboxing)
                - Apple AGX GPU driver (Apple GPU)
                - Nova GPU driver (AI craze Nvidia GPU)

        T: If no character device was merged yet and therefore
        no abstractions are available: What are we using instead?

        - Why are we using a virtual environment?
            - Linux is a monolithic kernel -> Modules are plugins -> Panics are mapped to kernel panics.
            - The kernel needs to support various architectures. These can be simulated to an extent.
            - Debuggers would not work as they need to stop the debugged process.

        - For our purposes we use buildroot to build a tiny linux userland (bash, ssh, vim)
        - Qemu is used as the hardware emulator.
        - Starting Qemu with a linux kernel and a preconfigured rootfs, creates a test environment
          accessable via SSH.
        - I automated all these steps with bash and make.
        - All resources are available on github with a length README explaining everything
          in detail. Building from scratch takes roughly 45m.

        T: Lets play around with the morse code module and take a look at the code afterwards.

        Show in Demo:

        - Enable Rust support in Linux.
        - Build and deploy module.
        - Load module show devices
        - Reload module with a custom devices / errors. Show sysfs maybe.
        - Use cat to show the content. Blocked IO.
        - Use echo to write SOS. Cat something really large.

        Show in dev env:

        - Linux configuration
        - Rust support and sample code
        - Build and login

        Show in code:

        - Entry point: Module Macro + init function
        - Fileoperations:
            - open
            - release
            - write
            - read

           Should I write my kernel modules in Rust?

        - In-tree modules: Talk to the Rust-For-Linux Developers.
          Your module might be a valid use-case to merge more Rust code into

        == Lessions learned
    ]

    - Rust plays well together with plain C.
    - Fearless concurrency is a thing, especially in the kernel space.
    - Proper tooling without cargo can be hard to setup.
    - Abstractions are currently limited.

    #pdfpc.speaker-note(
        ```md
        - Rust language mechanisms map well to C, although the Kernels
          interface design shows in the abstraction.
